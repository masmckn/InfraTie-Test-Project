    - The end result does not need to look exactly like the example, much of the example was built using bootstrap example components, feel free to use those.
    - When finished, please send a GitHub link showing your code along with a screen recording of your site
    - If you are unable to complete all of the instructions that is fine, just submit a recording of what you have along with the GitHub link of your code. 



    - Attempt to Create a Django application with the following three pages

        - Login page and logout function X
            - Login X
                - Username X 
                - Password X
                - Login button X
                - Message telling the user they have entered incorrect credentials if applicable (Only show this message if a login attempt has failed) X
            - No need to create a register function, create a super user instead using 'python manage.py createsuperuser' X
            - Once a user has provided the correct username and password, route them to the home page X

        - Home page
            - If a user is not logged in, redirect them to login page X
            - The home page should contain the following:
                - Currently logged in username X
                - Logout link X
                - A clickable table displaying all fields from the Inspection model
                    - When a user clicks on a table row, redirect them to the redirected page which will display all the conditions with that inspection as a foreign key
                    - Use a JQuery event listener to determine when a user has clicked on a table row and which row

        - Conditions page
            - If a user is not logged in, redirect them to login page
            - The Conditions page should contain the following:
                - Currently logged in username
                - Logout link
                - A table containing only the requested inspection's data
                - A table containing the conditions associated with the requested inspection (Foreign key)

Create the following models and use the provided SQL file to insert data into the tables
Models:

```
    class Inspection(models.Model):
        Attribute_1 = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        Attribute_2 = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        Attribute_3 = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        Attribute_4 = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        Attribute_5 = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        Attribute_6 = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        Attribute_7 = models.CharField(max_length=50)

        def __str__(self):
            return self.id
    
        class Meta:
            db_table = "Inspection"

    class Condition(models.Model):
        Inspection = models.ForeignKey(
            Inspection,
            on_delete=models.CASCADE
        )
        Attribute_1 = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        Attribute_2 = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        Attribute_3 = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        Attribute_4 = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        Attribute_5 = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        Attribute_6 = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        Attribute_7 = models.CharField(max_length=50)

        def __str__(self):
            return self.id
        
        class Meta:
            db_table = "Condition"
```
